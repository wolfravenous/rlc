puts (5 % 3)     # prints  2

#  We call q and r respectively the quotient and the remainder
#  of the Euclidean division of b by a.  So, using the formula
#  b = aq + r the above yields 5 = 3 * 1 + 2

puts (-5 % 3)    # prints  1  

#  Using the same formula b = aq + r  when we solve for r the 
#  formula reads like this (-5) = 3 * (-2) + 1

puts (5 % -3)    # prints -1 

#  Using the same formula b = aq + r  when we solve for r the 
#  formula reads like this 5 = (-3) * (-2) + (-1)
 
puts (-5 % -3)   # prints -2

#  Using the same formula b = aq + r  when we solve for r the 
#  formula reads like this (-5) = (-3) * 1 + (-2)
